# Terrain-Eye
A deep learning approach for terrain recognition and environment perception. It integrates EfficientNetB3 and YOLOv8 to classify terrain images, detect objects and ROIs, and estimate implicit features such as roughness, objects, and people/crowd density. The solution is flexible and can be manipulated for specific use-cases.
